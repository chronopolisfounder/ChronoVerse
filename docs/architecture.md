## 1. Frontend

- **Framework:**
  - React (Vite bundler) for fast development and hot reloads
  - Tailwind CSS for Tron/chrome/glass style theming
  - shadcn/ui and Lucide icons for component consistency

  - Modular components in `/src/components`
  - Page-level routing via React Router in `/src/pages`
  - Custom hooks and contexts for API/data/state management
- **Features:**
  - Avatar system with SVG and real-time updates
  - Public health dashboards, rewards, research registry, mentor AI panel
  - Background glow and sound for immersive UX

## 2. Backend

- **API Layer:**
  - Node.js/Express REST API (or Next.js API routes)
  - All API calls via `chrono.fetch()` abstraction for consistency and logging
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL for primary data (users, research, rewards, logs)
  - Redis or similar for real-time session/pod state
- **Authentication:**
  - OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens and optional MFA
- **Data Integrity:**
  - All research/events validated against schema (see `/docs/schema.md`)
  - Audit logs for sensitive actions

## 3. Real-Time & Collaboration

- **WebSockets:**
  - Live research pods and chat via secure WebSocket channels
- **Pod Logic:**
  - Each collaboration pod has a unique session, moderator AI, and event-driven updates
- **Notifications:**
  - Real-time alerts for milestones, new modules, pod invites

## 4. Security & Compliance

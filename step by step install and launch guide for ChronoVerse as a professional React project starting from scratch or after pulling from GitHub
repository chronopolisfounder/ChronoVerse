# üöÄ ChronoVerse Setup & Install Guide

**1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.**

**2. Go to your ChronoVerse project root:**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Logan\Documents\ChronoVerse\chronoverse"
```

*(If you just cloned or unzipped, adjust the path as needed)*

---

**3. Install all dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

*(This reads your `package.json` and installs everything needed, including React, Tailwind, Router, etc.)*

---

**4. (Optional, but recommended) Run Prettier and Lint to clean up formatting and find code issues:**

```bash
npm run format    # (if "format" script exists in package.json)
npm run lint      # (if "lint" script exists)
```

*(If you get an error like ‚Äúmissing script‚Äù, you can skip these for now.)*

---

**5. Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

* **You‚Äôll see output like**:
  `Local: http://localhost:3000`
* **Open that URL in your browser.**
* You should see your ChronoVerse app‚Äîstyled, with navigation, and all pages!

---

**6. If you want to build for production (e.g. for Vercel deploy):**

```bash
npm run build
```

---

**7. If using git & Vercel:**

* Stage, commit, and push changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Setup ChronoVerse project: install and build"
  git push
  ```
* Wait for Vercel to deploy from your repo.

---

# **Troubleshooting**

* **If you see ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù or ‚Äúnpm not recognized‚Äù**:

  * Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed, and close/reopen your terminal after install.

* **If nothing appears at `localhost:3000`:**

  * Double-check you‚Äôre in the right folder and the dev server started without errors.
  * Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R).

* **If a page is blank or missing:**

  * Check for typos in file names or imports.
  * Make sure routes are registered in `App.jsx`.

---

**That‚Äôs it!
ChronoVerse is installed, running, and ready to develop.
Update, push, or deploy as needed.**
